## Env and Utils

- `env_wildfire_ca.py`: This defines the "wildfireCA-v0" environment. 

- `wildfire_ca.py`: This defines the "wildfireCA" object which allows the user to do some basic wildfire modelling. Open the script for more details, but it is possible to allow for wind, elevation, differences in vegetable and density. If you run `python wildfire_ca.py`, there will be a GUI displaying the dynamics.
