## Examples

- `ppo.py`: This trains an agent using a custom CNN policy with PPO to interact with the environment.

- `reactive_agent.py`: Here I created a very simple reactive agent that performs preventative burns around any active cells. To run with a GUI, using the flag `--display`. To change the environment, use the flag `--env`.
